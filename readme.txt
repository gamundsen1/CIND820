Project Name
Predicting NHL Regular Season and Postseason Success
Description
This project investigates team performance in the NHL, both regular season and postseason.  The objective is to determine which team statistics can be used to predict success in the regular season and in the postseason.  
Data
Data for the project is taken from the NHL website (http://www.nhl.com/stats/teams)
Roadmap
Regular season success is studied first, using point percentage as a target variable.  Previous research has shown that goal-based and shot-based metrics are the most predictive.  Additional variables are also included to evaluate possible improvements to predictive models.  Three types of regression models are used and compared to find the most suitable, including linear regression, XG boost regression and ridge regression.
Postseason success is studies next, considering wins as a target variable.  The most successful models from the regular season are re-trained using postseason data and compared to determine relative success.  Smaller sample sizes of number of games played and teams involved in the postseason make prediction more challenging.
Finally, postseason success is predicted using regular season statistics as input since the regular season statistics are based on a larger sample of games played.
